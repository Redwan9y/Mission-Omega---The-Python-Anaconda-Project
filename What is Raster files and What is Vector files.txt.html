Let’s take a step back before actually defining the vector file. When you work on any digital project, you’ll encounter two distinct types of image files — raster and vector. They’re formed in different ways and are better suited to some projects than others.

 

Raster files are composed of a fixed number of square pixels. This means raster files can become distorted if you resize them beyond the amount of space the pixels were meant to fill.

 

Vector images don’t use pixels. They’re created with mathematical equations, lines, and curves — using points fixed on a grid — which means images can be made infinitely larger (or smaller) without losing resolution. Basically, vectors don’t lose quality when resized.

 

At the same time, don’t confuse either raster or vector formats with RAW files, which are unaltered, uncompressed images made up of direct data taken from a camera’s sensors. All three offer their own specific advantages, disadvantages and ultimately, use cases.




With Photoshop, you can save an image as a PDF vector, which is resolution-independent and good for printing. To do that, open the image in Photoshop, and click File > Save As. Then select "PDF" and in the next window, select "Vector" and click "Save."

What is a raster file?
Raster files are images built from pixels — tiny color squares that, in great quantity, can form highly detailed images such as photographs. The more pixels an image has, the higher quality it will be, and vice versa. The number of pixels in an image depends on the file type (for example, JPEG, GIF, or PNG).

Raster files display a wider array of colors, permit greater color editing, and show finer light and shading than vectors — but they lose image quality when resized. An easy way to tell if an image is raster or vector is to increase its size. If the image becomes blurred or pixelated, it's most likely a raster file.
An array is an arrangement of numbers, pictures or objects formatted into rows and columns according to their type. In coding and programming, an array is a collection of items, or data, stored in contiguous memory locations, also known as database systems .

To define the color or shading of object displayed on screen or printed on paper, color values are used, which are typically based on color models. Models may include a single color (such as for the grayscale model) or multiple colors.







Raster files.
The raster file format, along with vector, is one of the main two file types used for digital images. One of the strengths of raster files is the ability to capture detailed graphics and high-quality photographs taken from digital cameras. Explore the key features of raster images, their most common uses, and how they differ from vector images. 


What is a raster file?

There are two main types of digital image file — raster and vector. Digital photos and detailed graphics both come in raster form. Popular types of raster files include JPEG, PNG, and GIF images.

 

However, because their pixel number is fixed, raster images can become distorted or blurry when resized to fill a bigger or smaller space. That’s why vector images are more commonly used for illustrations and logos — vectors are made up of mathematical formulas that can scale up or down infinitely. This means that, compared to pixels, vectors don’t lose their resolution when resized.

 

Raw photo files, which contain uncompressed image data taken directly from a camera’s sensors, are generally converted to raster files once edited.

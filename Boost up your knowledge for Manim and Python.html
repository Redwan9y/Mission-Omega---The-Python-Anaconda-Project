Manim is the library made up of several parts  .
(1)Manim Issues python to convert manim figure to a spacial language.
(2)This spacial laguage transfered into a program called cairo.cairo transfer spacial language into a series of images which are all frames of the anemations.and at the same time cairo sent those images into anather program called ffmpeg.
(3)ffmpeg convert those images into video.

Manim was created as a bridge between the FFmpeg video encoding engine and Python. Since you can't communicate built-in Python data structures to FFmpeg, Manim implements several mathematical object representation and animation classes.









                  Create a PYTHON Library 
How to create a Python library::::
Ever wanted to create a Python library, albeit for your team at work or for some open source project online? In this blog you will learn how to!

The tutorial is easiest to follow when you are using the same tools, however it is also possible for you to use different ones.

The tools used in this tutorial are:
- Linux command prompt
- Visual Studio Code

Step 1: Create a directory in which you want to put your library
Open your command prompt and create a folder in which you will create your Python library.

Remember:
- With pwd you can see your present working directory.
- With ls you can list the folders and files in your directory.
- With cd <path> you can change the current present directory you are in.
- With mkdir <folder> you can create a new folder in your working directory.

In my case, the folder I will be working with is mypythonlibrary. Change the present working directory to be your folder.

Step 2: Create a virtual environment for your folder
When starting your project, it is always a good idea to create a virtual environment to encapsulate your project. A virtual environment consists of a certain Python version and some libraries.

Virtual environments prevent the issue of running into dependency issues later on. For example, in older projects you might have worked with older versions of the numpy library. Some old code, that once worked beautifully, might stop working once you update its version. Perhaps parts of numpy are no longer compatible with other parts of your program. Creating virtual environments prevents this. They are also useful in cases when you are collaborating with someone else, and you want to make sure that your application is working on their computer, and vice versa.

(Make sure you changed the present working directory to the folder you are going to create your Python library in (cd <path/to/folder>).)

Go ahead and create a virtual environment by typing:
> python3 -m venv venv

Once it is created, you must now activate the environment by using:
> source venv/bin/activate

Activating a virtual environment modifies the PATH and shell variables to point to the specific isolated Python set-up you created. PATH is an environmental variable in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that tells the shell which directories to search for executable files (i.e., ready-to-run programs) in response to commands issued by a user. The command prompt will change to indicate which virtual environment you are currently in by prepending (yourenvname).

In your environment, make sure you have pip installed wheel, setuptools and twine. We will need them for later to build our Python library.
> pip install wheel
> pip install setuptools
> pip install twine

Step 3: Create a folder structure
In Visual Studio Code, open your folder mypythonlibrary (or any name you have given your folder). It should look something like this:


You now can start adding folders and files to your project. You can do this either through the command prompt or in Visual Studio Code itself.

Create an empty file called setup.py. This is one of the most important files when creating a Python library!
Create an empty file called README.md. This is the place where you can write markdown to describe the contents of your library for other users.
Create a folder called mypythonlib, or whatever you want your Python library to be called when you pip install it. (The name should be unique on pip if you want to publish it later.)
Create an empty file inside mypythonlib that is called __init__.py. Basically, any folder that has an __init__.py file in it, will be included in the library when we build it. Most of the time, you can leave the __init__.py files empty. Upon import, the code within __init__.py gets executed, so it should contain only the minimal amount of code that is needed to be able to run your project. For now, we will leave them as is.
Also, in the same folder, create a file called myfunctions.py.
And, finally, create a folder tests in your root folder. Inside, create an empty __init__.py file and an empty test_myfunctions.py.
Your set-up should now look something like this:


Step 4: Create content for your library
To put functions inside your library, you can place them in the myfunctions.py file. For example, copy the haversine function in your file:

from math import radians, cos, sin, asin, sqrt
def haversine(lon1: float, lat1: float, lon2: float, lat2: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the great circle distance between two points on the 
    earth (specified in decimal degrees), returns the distance in
    meters.
    All arguments must be of equal length.
    :param lon1: longitude of first place
    :param lat1: latitude of first place
    :param lon2: longitude of second place
    :param lat2: latitude of second place
    :return: distance in meters between the two sets of coordinates
    """
    # Convert decimal degrees to radians
    lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2 = map(radians, [lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2])

    # Haversine formula
    dlon = lon2 - lon1
    dlat = lat2 - lat1
    a = sin(dlat/2)**2 + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * sin(dlon/2)**2
    c = 2 * asin(sqrt(a))
    r = 6371 # Radius of earth in kilometers
    return c * r
This function will give us the distance in meters between two latitude and longitude points.

Whenever you write any code, it is highly encouraged to also write tests for this code. For testing with Python you can use the libraries pytest and pytest-runner. Install the library in your virtual environment:
> pip install pytest==4.4.1
> pip install pytest-runner==4.4

Let’s create a small test for the haversine function. Copy the following and place it inside the test_myfunctions.py file:

from mypythonlib import myfunctions
def test_haversine():
    assert myfunctions.haversine(52.370216, 4.895168, 52.520008,
    13.404954) == 945793.4375088713
Finally, let’s create a setup.py file, that will help us to build the library. A limited version of setup.py will look something like this:

from setuptools import find_packages, setup
setup(
    name='mypythonlib',
    packages=find_packages(),
    version='0.1.0',
    description='My first Python library',
    author='Me',
    license='MIT',
)
The name variable in setup holds whatever name you want your package wheel file to have. To make it easy, we will gave it the same name as the folder.

Set the packages you would like to create
While in principle you could use find_packages() without any arguments, this can potentially result in unwanted packages to be included. This can happen, for example, if you included an __init__.py in your tests/ directory (which we did). Alternatively, you can also use the exclude argument to explicitly prevent the inclusion of tests in the package, but this is slightly less robust. Let’s change it to the following:

from setuptools import find_packages, setup
setup(
    name='mypythonlib',
    packages=find_packages(include=['mypythonlib']),
    version='0.1.0',
    description='My first Python library',
    author='Me',
    license'MIT',
)
Set the requirements your library needs
Note that pip does not use requirements.yml / requirements.txt when your project is installed as a dependency by others. Generally, for that, you will have to specify dependencies in the install_requires and tests_require arguments in your setup.py file.

Install_requires should be limited to the list of packages that are absolutely needed. This is because you do not want to make users install unnecessary packages. Also note that you do not need to list packages that are part of the standard Python library.

However, since we have only defined the haversine function so far and it only uses the math library (which is always available in Python), we can leave this argument empty.

Maybe you can remember us installing the pytest library before. Of course, you do not want to add pytest to your dependencies in install_requires: it isn’t required by the users of your package. In order to have it installed automatically only when you run tests you can add the following to your setup.py:

from setuptools import find_packages, setup
setup(
    name='mypythonlib',
    packages=find_packages(include=['mypythonlib']),
    version='0.1.0',
    description='My first Python library',
    author='Me',
    license='MIT',
    install_requires=[],
    setup_requires=['pytest-runner'],
    tests_require=['pytest==4.4.1'],
    test_suite='tests',
)
Running:
> python setup.py pytest
will execute all tests stored in the ‘tests’ folder.

Step 5: Build your library
Now that all the content is there, we want to build our library. Make sure your present working directory is /path/to/mypythonlibrary (so the root folder of your project). In your command prompt, run:
> python setup.py bdist_wheel

Your wheel file is stored in the “dist” folder that is now created. You can install your library by using:
> pip install /path/to/wheelfile.whl

Note that you could also publish your library to an internal file system on intranet at your workplace, or to the official PyPI repository and install it from there.

Once you have installed your Python library, you can import it using:
import mypythonlib
from mypythonlib import myfunctions










                       What is Library in CSE
In computer science, a library is a collection of non-volatile resources used by computer programs, often for software development. These may include configuration data, documentation, help data, message templates, pre-written code and subroutines, classes, values or type specifications. In IBM's OS/360 and its successors they are referred to as partitioned data sets.[1]

middle of execution. In this case the library is called a dynamic library (loaded at runtime). A dynamic library can be loaded and linked when preparing a program for execution, by the linker. Alternatively, in the middle of execution, an application may explicitly request that a module be loaded.

Most compiled languages have a standard library, although programmers can also create their own custom libraries. Most modern software systems provide libraries that implement the majority of the system services. Such libraries have organized the services which a modern application requires. As such, most code used by modern applications is provided in these system libraries.








  
                Python Standard Library
The Python Standard Library is a collection of script modules accessible to a Python program to simplify the programming process and removing the need to rewrite commonly used commands. They can be used by 'calling/importing' them at the beginning of a script.

A script is a Python file that's intended to be run directly. When you run it, it should do something. This means that scripts will often contain code written outside the scope of any classes or functions. A module is a Python file that's intended to be imported into scripts or other modules.

What are the most useful Python modules from the standard library...
The datetime module. ...
The math module. ...
The random module (Pseudo -random numbers) ...
The re module. ...
The os module. ...
The io module. ...
The json module. ...
The copy module.

Module:::A module is a Python object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference. Simply, a module is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes and variables. A module can also include runnable code.





                         Packages ::::::
Packages are a collection of related modules that aim to achieve a common goal. Finally, the Python standard library is a collection of packages and modules that can be used to access built-in functionality. In an ideal world, you'd import any necessary modules into your Python scripts without any issues.

                          Library  ::::::
A Python package defines the code as a separate unit for each function when using a library. 

                           Module  ::::::
While the modules themselves are a distinct library with built-in functionality, the advantage of packages over modules is their reusability.

      So this is the difference between a module and a package in Python.






                  Module install via PIP  :::
pip is a package-management system written in Python and is used to install and manage software packages. The Python Software Foundation recommends using pip for installing Python applications and its dependencies during deployment. 

The standard package manager for Python is pip . It allows you to install and manage packages that aren't part of the Python standard library.

How to install all pip modules?
The easiest way to update all packages in a Windows environment is to use pip in conjunction with Windows PowerShell:
Open a command shell by typing 'powershell' in the Search Box of the Task bar. Now,
Enter: pip freeze | %{$_.split('==')[0]} | %{pip install --upgrade $_}

How to install external modules in Python using pip?
Installing Python modules in Windows

The Python package manager (pip) allows for the installation of modules and packages. Open a terminal and use the pip command to install a module across the entire system.









                       Os module in Python  :
The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. OS comes under Python's standard utility modules. This module provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality. The *os* and *os.path* modules include many functions to interact with the file system.

In computer software, a module is an extension to a main program dedicated to a specific function. In programming, a module is a section of code that is added in as a whole or is designed for easy reusability.

Does os module come with Python?
Getting Started. Python's OS module comes packaged within python when installed. This means you do not need to separately install it using PIP. In order to access its various methods/functions, you just need to import the module.










                             Directory  ::::::
A  directory is a collection of files and subdirectories. A directory inside a directory is known as a subdirectory. Python has the os module that provides us with many useful methods to work with directories (and files as well).













                    Chocolatey ( Choco )  ::::::
It is software management automation for Windows that wraps installers, executables, zips, and scripts into compiled packages.








                               Latex  ::::::
LaTeX (/ˈlɑːtɛk/ LAH-tek or /ˈleɪtɛk/ LAY-tek, often stylized as LaTeX) is a software system for document preparation. When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to the formatted text found in WYSIWYG word processors like Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer and Apple Pages.








                                    cURL ::::::
cURL is stands for client URL. A cURL is an open-source command-line tool used to create network requests to transfer data across a network. In Python cURL, this data-request transfer to and from servers is done using PycURL. This request tool also helps in testing REST APIs and downloading files.

Related to pip installation

PycURL is a Python interface to libcurl. PycURL can be used to fetch objects identified by a URL from a Python program, similar to the urllib Python module. PycURL is mature, very fast, and supports a lot of features.

libcurl is a free and easy-to-use client-side URL transfer library, supporting DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, GOPHERS, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, MQTT, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTMPS, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP.
It is an API.

An application programming interface is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software. A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification.
APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. For example, the weather bureau's software system contains daily weather data. The weather app on your phone “talks” to this system via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone.








                              Docker  ::::::
Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. The service has both free and premium tiers. The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine. It was first started in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc.

Docker container is an isolated environment for your code. This means that a container has no knowledge of your operating system, or your files. It runs on the environment provided to you by Docker Desktop. This is why a container usually has everything that your code needs in order to run, down to a base operating system.
